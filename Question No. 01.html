        /* 1. The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties :
           title, which is a string representing the title of the movie
           studio, which is a string representing the studio that made the movie
           rating, which is a string representing the rating of the movie(i. e. PG13, R etc)

            A. Write a constructor for the class movie, which takes a string representing the title of the movie, a string representing the
               studio and a string representinig the reting as its arguments and sets the respective class properties to these values.

            B. The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no reting is provided

            C. Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument and returns a new array of only those movies
               in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instance. The returned array need not be full.

            D. Write piece of code that creats an instance of the class Movie with the title "Casio Royale", the studio "Eon Productions" and the rating "PG13".*/
